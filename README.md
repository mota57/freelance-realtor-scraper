## Scrapper for realtor.

â€¢	I worked for a client where he needs to extend the realtor application with new button and dropdown, in order to extract the total houses per county base on certain price range and then combine the results   with data obtain from huduser.gov. Finally, after the code completes it will download a csv sheet.

* Must select
  * min price and max price.
  * min bed and max bed.
